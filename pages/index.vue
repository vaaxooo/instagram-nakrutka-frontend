                        <p class="lead">Thanks to likes, publications used to get to the top and recommended. But Instagram has complicated the task and now such indicators as reach and other activity of visitors to the publication are important for the rating. All this can also be tweaked.</p>
                        <p class="lead">It is considered that the benchmark for the number of likes under each publication is 10% of the number of subscribers on a given page. If the number of likes is significantly lower, it immediately catches the eye and causes distrust.</p>

                        <p class="lead">Views have replaced likes under video publications. Views clearly give an idea of the audience reach of publications on your page, whether there is active traffic to publications or only bots are active on your page.</p>
                        <p class="lead">This is a very important indicator that is often neglected. But the number of views should be much higher than the number of likes. If a video has few views, it immediately indicates a lack of a live audience on the page.</p>

                        <p class="lead">Comments are the hardest to spruce up and they affect both your instagram ranking and rating in the eyes of users. With enough comments, you can easily get to the top of hashtag and geo-tagging picks, as well as the recommended ones.</p>
                        <p class="lead">Users are more likely to share their opinions under posts that someone has already commented on. The more comments a page has, the more attractive it seems to casual visitors and regular subscribers.</p>
